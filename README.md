Py City Analysis

•	Based on the analysis medium sized schools had higher passing rates in all categories (Math, Read and Overall) overall. This factor could be attributed to their student: teacher ratio and a host of other factors. It’s important to note that medium sized schools outperformed large schools by 19% and small schools by 1%.

•	I would also like to highlight my findings regarding spending ranges per student. The analysis concluded students who attend schools with higher spending ranges per student, did not outperform their peers who attend schools with smaller spend per student. This factor is very important seeing that most schools struggle with maintaining their expenses. I believe this matter deserves more attention/analysis.

•	Lastly, the analysis allowed some insight into school type. It appears that student who attend charter schools score higher on their Math and Reading versus their peers in district schools. The delta for scoring is massive, ranging from 3%-22%. Could this be due to curriculum, culture, or other factors?

### Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

* Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include all of the same metrics as above.

### Math Scores by Grade\*\*

* Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

* Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Scores by School Size

* Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

### Scores by School Type

* Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
